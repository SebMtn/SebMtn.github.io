We went from working all day long to provide the very basics of survival to having more free time, more luxurious food, more sophisticated past-times than could ever be thought possible.</p><p>Democracy has led to the highest drop in inequality in our history. We went from the nobility having the right of life and death over starving peasants to the concept of middle class.</p><p>But our current form of governance (democracy and capitalism) is broken. While it was able to get us out of straw houses, it is unable to get humanity to the next level. It is incapable of making efficient decisions, as illustrated with the poor track-record of humanity in meeting the challenges of climate change that have been known for more than 50 years.</p><p>Capitalism has turned to a predatory form, where there is too little correlation between individual rewards and common well-being. The individual pursuit of wealth is not increasing the common good anymore. Too many of the sharpest minds are turning to the highest-paying endeavours, with little positive externality. Compounded by rising inequalities, this has led to increase resentment and class warfare that will only get worse if we do not change course.</p><p>It is irrelevant whether the fault is more with democracy or with capitalism. They both go hand in hand, and one serves the other in the Western world. To the individual citizens, only the results matter. We only perceive the outcome of the system, and it does not matter if the powers influencing the job markets, the ads on tv or climate change think themselves as economic or political.</p><p>The level of discontent with our system is so high that many people in the Western world have started to relativise the model and actions of dictatorships across the world. The unhappiness in the wealthiest parts of the world is so strong that countries employing systematic persecutions, totalitarianism and even genocides do not necessarily appear to have a governance system drastically inferior.</p><p>This distrust in our system is so dire, so critical to the future of our civilization that none of us can shy away from that problem. If we do not change course very soon, we will elect increasingly shrill populists who will lead us towards ruin. And the phenomenon is not restricted to any single country. It manifests slightly differently, but it is present in all Western countries.</p><p>Our elites have ignored the problem for decades. Not because they didn&rsquo;t care, but because they had no idea how to solve it. The electorate, which does not dwell on the details of the reasons or causes of the predicament, is so fed up that they started to elect whoever promised the most different path. And because none of the elite had any clue, they didn&rsquo;t offer any significant solution. That is of course an environment where demagogues shine. The Western World started to elect populists who also had no idea how to solve the problems, but were happy to promulgate simplistic ideas to get elected and obtain personal power.</p><p>This observation is widely shared. But what solutions are proposed?</p><hr><h2 id=the-current-solution>The current solution<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#the-current-solution>#</a></h2><h3 id=the-lefts-approach>The Left&rsquo;s approach<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#the-lefts-approach>#</a></h3><p>The Left tends to blame capitalism. Their solution is more regulation, more government.</p><p>But in spite of the rich capturing an increasing proportion of the nations’ wealth, socialists&rsquo; rhetoric is failing to get a proper foothold. Why is the Left performing so poorly in an environment of increasing inequalities? Because we have seen this movie before. We know from all the communists and extreme socialist countries around the world that this is not the answer. In addition, and very importantly, we distrust the government. We know governments are unable to utilize efficiently the enormous sums of money at their disposal. We have experienced too many times that more government destroys wealth, increases corruption and removes freedom, under the guise of reducing inequality and increasing security.</p><p>The critical point is that the government, like any central authority, is terrible at making decisions in the interest of the Common Good. Form a committee with the smartest people on the planet to make decisions affecting the lives of millions of people, and they will get to a solution that does not work for most people. There is no way around it. The world is way too complex for any central authority to be able to solve our modern problems.</p><p>That is in fact the grand lesson of the 20th century. Why did capitalism outperform communism? Certainly not because of its ideology : communism actually feels much nicer, human and utopist than the dry free-for-all of capitalism. It outperformed because it decentralized decisions. It did not rely on a central authority. And as society delegated decisions to the individuals, they were able to make the right choices that made them personally wealthier and happier. The benefit was so strong that most countries elected the less sexy, more efficient ideology.</p><h3 id=the-rights-approach>The Right&rsquo;s approach<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#the-rights-approach>#</a></h3><p>On the other side of the aisle, the Right tackles our current predicament by doubling down on unbridled capitalism. It closes its eyes on the massacre free markets are causing to the environment. It praises the all-time highs of the stock markets, oblivious to the massive increases in poverty for an ever larger part of the population.
The critical point that I take away on this side of the debate is the failure to recognize the limitation of capitalism : optimization by each individual does not lead to the optimal Common Good.</p><p>So what is the answer? Ignoring the terrible side effects of capitalism, the right-wing solution, or increasing government, the left-wing solution?</p><p>Our elites have been grappling with that conundrum, but the people know deeply that either approach is flawed. And the results are all time high distrust in society and its elites.</p><p>We absolutely need more governance of our economic system. If we are to prosper as a society, and perhaps even to simply survive, we imperatively need our collective work to lead to a good outcome for humanity. Our work cannot be detrimental to our climate, health, happiness and well-being. It has to be aligned with the Common Good. A central authority (government) trying to align the gigantic machine of capitalism and its millions of self-centered agents to the Common Good is an impossible task.</p><hr><h2 id=the-proposed-solution>The proposed solution<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#the-proposed-solution>#</a></h2><p>So I would like to propose a new way, a solution that gets outside of the trade-off greedy capitalism versus incompetent government. The core of the issue is that we assigned the mission to determine what the Common Good is to a central authority, the government. This is failing in the same way that communism failed when it assigned it the mission to allocate the means of production. So the solution is obvious : do not ask the government what the Common Good is, ask each individual. In the same way that local optimization of their personal wealth by individuals led to much more overall wealth, local optimization of the Personal Good will result in much more Common Good.</p><p>It is impossible for a central authority to quantify how much more valuable to the locals cleaning a certain beach would be versus creating a bicycle path. But that question has an obvious answer to each individual involved. So let&rsquo;s simply get the government out of the question of evaluating what is the Common Good, and let&rsquo;s decentralize that question.</p><p>Concretely, I propose that the value of each good or service has its price shifted up or down depending on how much Common Good it brings. The delta to this transaction is either added or removed from the Common Good Fund. The client pays the same price, irrespective of this delta, and does not even have to be aware of this mechanism.</p><p>This delta is determined by a decentralized vote. One person, one vote.
When the transaction is perceived as beneficial by the decentralized vote, the delta is positive, and the seller receives an additional amount on his sale, paid from the Common Good Fund. When the transaction is perceived as detrimental to the Common Good, the delta is negative and the amount is debited from the sales price, to enter the Common Good Fund.</p><h3 id=illustration-of-the-process>Illustration of the process<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#illustration-of-the-process>#</a></h3><figure class=align-center><img loading=lazy src=/process_delta_illustration_1.png#center alt="Process for Ethical Capitalism payment flow" width=100%></figure><ul><li><p>δ, the Common Good Coefficient, is an integer value between -100 and +∞. A positive value represents a positive externality, i.e. the transaction is beneficial to the rest of the world, outside of the client and provider. A negative value represents a negative externality.</p></li><li><p>As this project develop, the blockchain vote could evolve from a wide to narrow voting:</p><ul><li>wide : δ is determined for all goods and services of each firm.
For example, Company X’s main business activity sells cigarettes, and is assigned a δ of -0.5 for everything it sells, even if not cigarettes. In other words, δ represents the averaged Common Good Coefficient across all the company’s goods and services.</li><li>average : δ is determined for each type of goods and services of each firm.
For example, Company X’s cigarette selling transactions have a δ of -0.8, but this company’s nicotine patch selling transactions have a δ of +0.3</li><li>narrow : δ is assigned to each specific transaction
That would allow for not only adjusting the δ to the product and the company, but also to the client. Indeed a certain type of good and service could have varying social impact, depending on who the recipient is (e.g. selling advertising slots to a charity might be seens as less detrimental than selling advertising slots to a tobacco company)</li></ul></li></ul><h3 id=comparison-to-the-current-model>Comparison to the current model<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#comparison-to-the-current-model>#</a></h3><p>This idea is so different from anything we know that it might sound far-fetched at first sight. But let&rsquo;s compare it to the current flow from <strong>Work</strong> to <strong>Common Good</strong>.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Centralized model (current model)</th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1. Work is performed. A good or service is sold. The government takes an amount from that transaction via a highly complex tax system, irrespective of whether the transaction is beneficial or not for society overall.</td><td><em>Inefficient. Companies could spend all their resources in selling something that is detrimental to the greater good.</em></td></tr><tr><td>2. Government determines what is the most urgent task to achieve for the Common Good. Is it cleaning the beach? Is it the new bicycle lane? Is it planting more trees?</td><td><em>Inefficient. A central authority cannot determine accurately what is the Common Good of many different individuals.</em></td></tr><tr><td>3. Government spends the money to try to achieve the desired outcome.</td><td><em>Inefficient. Central authorities cannot be competent in many areas, and they suffer from bureaucracy and corruption.</em></td></tr></tbody></table><table><thead><tr><th>Decentralized model (this proposal)</th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1. Work is performed. A good or service is sold. The price is marked up or down given its impact on the Common Good.</td><td><em>Efficient. Companies have direct incentive to spend their resources on something that is recognized as contributing to the Common Good.</em></td></tr><tr><td>2. A decentralized vote determines whether the work performed was in the interest or to the detriment of the Common Good, and by how much.</td><td><em>Efficient. The collective will of individuals is computed directly, specific to the transaction, rather than represented by the government elected on many criteria several years ago.</em></td></tr><tr><td>3. There is a direct incentive for companies and individuals to perform work that is aligned with the Common Good.</td><td><em>Efficient. Companies and individuals can focus on the subset of tasks that they are good at.</em></td></tr></tbody></table><h3 id=dynamic-pricing>Dynamic pricing<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#dynamic-pricing>#</a></h3><p>Of course, the decentralized votes are held regularly, and deltas adjust. The flows in and out of the Common Good Fund need to balance out to 0. At the beginning of the implementation of the model, many transactions are being voted as working against the Common Good, so they pay for the ones that are voted as good. Over time, fewer and fewer transactions are actively against the Common Good. Some remain, as humans have some bad habits they are willing to pay for (e.g. smoking). But even among the good transactions, some are voted as more strongly beneficial than others, and so over time, a negative delta to prices of transactions that are beneficial, but not enough, is applied. This ensures naturally that individuals spend their effort on the most valuable tasks for the Common Good.</p><h3 id=self-interest>Self-interest<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#self-interest>#</a></h3><p>The beauty of this proposal is that it still relies entirely on individual self-interest. As we can see in our society, the public shaming of CEOs for the evil behaviour of their company has little to no impact. While it is a beautiful ideal, like communism was, trying to elevate individuals&rsquo; moral standards is doomed to fail. This proposal does not try to change human nature, but simply makes sure that we align self-interest to common interest.</p><p>Imagine a world where the brightest minds do not compete to be lawyers, traders and lobbyists, but nurses, environmental scientists, beach cleaners, or whatever is voted the most beneficial for the greater good by the actual people? Imagine if the smartest entrepreneurs in the world were building CO2-capturing technologies instead of soul-destroying, addictive social media?</p><p>Humanity has an immense talent, we are the most clever we have ever been, we innovate at the fastest ever pace&mldr; And yet nothing we collectively agree to be the most important gets done. Governments are clearly failing. It is high time we change this absurdity by aligning our work to the Common Good.</p><p>And as an added bonus, all of our work will become much more meaningful. We will know for certain, and by how much we contribute to the Common Good. It is hard to be happy to pay taxes, not only because we have little trust it will be put to good use, but also because there is no correlation between the tax taken and the Common Good. Taxes are mostly the same for all transactions. Establishing a direct link between prices and Common Good will make our contribution much more tangible, and therefore our work more meaningful.</p><h3 id=decision-making-with-many-agents>Decision making with many agents<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#decision-making-with-many-agents>#</a></h3><p>Quantifying the externality (Common Good) of a transaction is a very hard problem. That is why a government, as a central authority, is unsuccessful in doing so, despite being well informed. Multiple partially informed agents voting to quantify it is the right process, not only because the agents themselves are the third-parties directly impacted, but also because this paradigm is the most effective one in this type of situation.
Mathematically, there is a parallel to be drawn with the ensemble methods in Machine Learning. When trying to quantify a difficult phenomenon, this type of technique groups together a large number of simple models. This has proven more effective in many cases than using a single sophisticated model.</p><h3 id=implementation-via-blockchain-technology>Implementation via blockchain technology<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#implementation-via-blockchain-technology>#</a></h3><p>In our predicament, we have the extraordinary good luck to have recently invented the most amazing tool for decentralized voting : the blockchain.
Its first use was to build something previously unheard-of : a currency that is outside the control of any government.
We can harness this tool to provide universal access to vote on the price of goods and services. Each of us can vote based on our self-interest. You might assign a positive delta to the planting of a tree in Norwegia, and a negative one to the selling of coal.</p><p>We will not be able to dictate prices for outside actors, so the approach will be to first create a cryptocurrency that is behaving in the manner I described : where a decentralized vote automatically adjust the price of the transaction, and automatically gets the adjustment in or out of the Common Good Fund. We can call this cryptocurrency Ethical Capitalism Currency (ECC).</p><h3 id=roadmap>Roadmap<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#roadmap>#</a></h3><h4 id=stage-1--communicate-ideas-to-finalize-whitepaper-from-feedback>Stage 1 : communicate ideas to finalize whitepaper from feedback<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#stage-1--communicate-ideas-to-finalize-whitepaper-from-feedback>#</a></h4><p>I communicate this document and these ideas via direct communication to personal acquaintances, and then via a public website.</p><p>This website is then disseminated to a few communities of people who share an interest in ethical capitalism.

So the workflow described above can actually take place.</p><p>Goals :</p><ul><li>technical implementation done, at the level of a minimum viable product</li><li>5 different participants have agreed to use that technology, to test it</li><li>10 transactions have taken place successfully</li></ul><h4 id=stage-3--communicate-and-enrol>Stage 3 : communicate and enrol<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#stage-3--communicate-and-enrol>#</a></h4><p>Start to communicate publicly about this project, build awareness about this idea. enroll real outside companies or self-employed/freelancer in this project, so that they start selling real goods and services via this system, in ECC. This is on top of at least 5 agents who support this effort and would purchase goods and services from this 1 real agent.</p><p>Goals :</p><ul><li>2,000 people have been made aware of this project</li><li>100 feedbacks have been collected on this project</li><li>1 real economic agent is enrolled and sells via this system</li></ul><h4 id=stage-4--scale>Stage 4 : scale<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#stage-4--scale>#</a></h4><p>Communicate more.

Either a government adopted this idea (top down approach), or so many companies are using it that it is effectively implemented (bottom up).</p><p>Goals :</p><ul><li>Either a government somewhere in the world tests this idea, with their own currency</li><li>Or 1,000 companies joined this project and sell via this mechanism</li></ul><h3 id=challenge--convince-companies-to-join>Challenge : convince companies to join<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#challenge--convince-companies-to-join>#</a></h3><p>In the early stages of the projects, a challenge will be to convince real companies to enter into this system. From their perspective, that means selling some goods and services via our ECC (Ethical Capitalism Currency), so that the rules of the Common Good Coefficient are enforced. There are a few ways to incentivize them :</p><ol><li><p>Incentive payments in cryptocurrency</p><p>At creation time of the ECC, we save some amount specifically designed to incentivise early participants.</p></li><li><p>Incentive payments in fiat currency</p><p>We can pool fiat currency to incentivise participants.</p></li><li><p>Negative delta is not paid to the fund</p><p>For the first stages, we can waive the price impact of a negative delta, so that companies are guaranteed to sell at the minimum price they set.</p></li><li><p>Companies can showcase their ethical credentials</p><p>Many companies are investing serious amounts of money to not only be more ethical, but also prove that they are so. As an example, large companies are hiring entire teams to implement the rules dictated by B corp. They go through the pain and costs of adapting their process, and on top of that, they actually have to pay B corp for them to review their case and potentially attribute some sustainability certificate.
This project of Ethical Capitalism can be seen by these companies as a way to get their behavior analyzed by a group representing the Common Good, in a bottom up manner, rather than analyzed and credited by a top down institution. Given the increasing distrust of institutions, it could be seen as a must-have to have the backing of truly independent citizens, who do not have a conflict of interest because they are not paid by the company to review their case.</p></li><li><p>Activism can push companies to enrol</p><p>This project creates a new avenue for ethical activism. Rather than pushing companies to adopt specific practices, they can simply encourage them to participate in this Ethical Capitalism ecosystem, so that they become truly accountable. That ensures companies behave ethically on the long term, on a broad range of subjects, without time-consuming monitoring by social activists.</p></li></ol><h3 id=conclusion>Conclusion<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#conclusion>#</a></h3><p>There are many issues to solve to get this idea to a practical implementation. I cannot solve this alone, and it would not make sense for me to do so even if I could. So please join me if you believe this project has a chance of making the world a better place for us all.</p></div></main><a href=#top aria-label="go to top" title="Go to Top (Alt + G)" class=top-link id=top-link accesskey=g><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 12 6" fill="currentcolor"><path d="M12 6H0l6-6z"/></svg></a><script>let menu=document.getElementById("menu");menu&&(menu.scrollLeft=localStorage.getItem("menu-scroll-position"),menu.onscroll=function(){localStorage.setItem("menu-scroll-position",menu.scrollLeft)}),document.querySelectorAll('a[href^="#"]').forEach(e=>{e.addEventListener("click",function(t){t.preventDefault();var e=this.getAttribute("href").substr(1);window.matchMedia("(prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)").matches?document.querySelector(`[id='${decodeURIComponent(e)}']`).scrollIntoView():document.querySelector(`[id='${decodeURIComponent(e)}']`).scrollIntoView({behavior:"smooth"}),e==="top"?history.replaceState(null,null," "):history.pushState(null,null,`#${e}`)})})</script><script>var mybutton=document.getElementById("top-link");window.onscroll=function(){document.body.scrollTop>800||document.documentElement.scrollTop>800?(mybutton.style.visibility="visible",mybutton.style.opacity="1"):(mybutton.style.visibility="hidden",mybutton.style.opacity="0")}</script><script>document.getElementById("theme-toggle").addEventListener("click",()=>{document.body.className.includes("dark")?(document.body.classList.remove("dark"),localStorage.setItem("pref-theme","light")):(document.body.classList.add("dark"),localStorage.setItem("pref-theme","dark"))})</script></body></html>
